## 🔍 Projects

### **1. FoodHub (EDA)**
Performed EDA using NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn to uncover demand patterns in cuisines and restaurants, and provided business recommendations.

### **2. Personal Loan Campaign (ML)**
Analyzed customer attributes and built a decision tree model to predict loan acquisition likelihood and guide marketing strategies.

### **3. Credit Card User Churn Prediction (ML)**
Built a predictive model to classify churn behavior using Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, SMOTE, and hyperparameter tuning.

### **4. Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Neural Networks)**
Developed an artificial neural network from scratch to identify high-risk churn customers using TensorFlow and Keras.

### **5. Plant Seedling Classification (Computer Vision)**
Built an image classifier to distinguish plant seedlings and weeds using TensorFlow, image processing, and transfer learning.

### **6. Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization (NLP)**
Built an AI-driven system to extract and summarize market sentiment from news articles using LLMs, Transformers, Prompt Engineering, and text preprocessing.

### **7. Standardized Test Analysis (EDA)
